# InventoryApplication

This is a simple inventory application that I made to help keep track of my rubiks cube collection. You are able to add new cubes to the collection, filter by brand, and search for cubes. 

This project was created using a postgres database to store the data simple SQL queries to update it. The HTML was generated using ejs.
